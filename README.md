# ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Recognization System
__________________
This research presents a deep learning-powered Traffic Sign Classification System that automatically recognizes traffic signs from images and provides corresponding road safety instructions. 

The system is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset and leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) model optimized for traffic sign recognition efficiency. 

The interface allows users to upload an image of a traffic sign, which is then classified into one of 43 categories. Corresponding road safety guidelines are displayed for each sign.
